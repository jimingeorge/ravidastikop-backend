      '<p align="justify">Teaching is my profession and it is in a kind of crisis. Indeed, my students struggle with broken learning processes, teachers struggle with defective delivery process. Let me elaborate and provide evidence. In a semester long course though designed for continuous learning students show peak learning efforts during and around 3 IAs and final exams. On the other hand, teachers deliver each class as if students are eagerly waiting for immediate learning. This is a serious synchronization challenges for both students as well as teacher. On student\'s side, the teacher\'s delivery becomes a kind of non-stop noise or sahasra nama and for a teacher it is a kind brochure reading in front of a uninterested customer. NO teacher nor the students want any of these situations, but with current teaching/learning processes most of them are unavoidable. </p><br /><p align="justify">Now I wish to attack this challenge face on. In other words, I wish to synchronise teaching delivery with learning consumption. In this regards, kindly ponder over the following questions and send your answers.</p><br /><ul><br /><li><div align="justify">What exactly is learner\'s problem?</div></li><br /><li><div align="justify">How can teacher solve it completely?</div></li><br /><li><div align="justify">How can teacher minimize student\'s total efforts of consumption and make it hassle free?</div></li><br /><li><div align="justify">How do I provide exactly what student\'s want?</div></li><br /><li><div align="justify">How do I deliver vlaue where he wants it?</div></li><br /><li><div align="justify">How do I reduce his efforts to solve his learning probem?<br /></div></li></ul><br /><p align="justify">I shall be pondering over these issues for some time. Please do send u r points and pointers.</p>',

      '<div align="justify">\n<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I am Ravindra Dastikop, currently working as an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department of <a href="http://www.sdmcet.ac.in/" target="_blank">SDM College of Engineering &nbsp;Technology, Dharwad. </a>I have been working in this institution since 1987 and have worked in different capacities. I started my career in the computer lab which was then part of Electronics and Communication Engineering department. Since early days I have taken fascination into computers and information technology aspects. In the past I have been the first user in my department to many of IT utilities such as emails. I created my first email account on hotmail way back in 1997. Developments in Information technology have always held my attention. In the recent years I have been using tools such as <a href="http://docs.google.com/">online docs </a>and presentation and <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=016390210553168334612:p9nfn1ntyaq&amp;hl=en">custom search engine </a>and more</span><br />\n<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>\n<div align="justify">\n</div>\n<div align="justify">\n<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">With the advent of <a href="http://webtwopoint.blogspot.com/2008/05/welcome-to-world-of-web-20.html">web 2.0</a> , I have been exploring a new genre of tools unleashed the web. Blogs seems to be the one I am currently attracted most. I have been using blogs extensively within the context of my profession i.e teaching. This is my home blog and from here you may get connected to all my other blogs- <a href="http://managementandentrepreneurship.blogspot.com/">teaching</a>, <a href="http://edusense.googlepages.com/">research</a> and <a href="http://winningwithweb.blogspot.com/">speaker.</a>&nbsp; Cloud computing has given me another world of resources and I have already harnessing them for <a href="http://cloudcomputingcourse.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">course teaching</a> and <a href="http://markmelive.com/" target="_blank">student projects&nbsp;</a></span></div>\n',
